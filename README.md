# Day 1: Search an element in an array

CodeChef Problem Link: https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/arrays/ARRAYS/problems/SEARCHINARR

## Approach/Logic:
First consider that the element is not present in the array.i.e. int flag=0
Traverse the array using the for loop and if any element matches with the one that we are searching for then update the value of flag to 1 and break
Outside the for loop if value of flag is 1 then print YES otherwise NO
